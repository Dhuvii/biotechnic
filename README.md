- A [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) account

## üîê Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=<your-mongodb-url>

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=<your-dataset>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2023-12-01

HUKOT_EMAIL=<your-email>
HUKOT_PASSWORD=<your-email-password>
HUKOT_SMTP_HOST=<your-smtp-host>
HUKOT_SMTP_PORT=465

## üí† Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure MongoDB

1. Sign up at [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).
2. Create a new project and then "Build a Database" using the free Shared tier.
3. Once your cluster is ready:

   - Add a new database user with username and password.
   - Under **Network Access**, allow access from your IP (or allow from anywhere).
   - Connect to the cluster using "Connect your application".
   - Copy the provided connection string and replace `<USERNAME>`, `<PASSWORD>`, and `<DBNAME>` with your actual credentials.

4. Set the resulting string as `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env.local`.

### Step 2: Create a Sanity Project

1. Go to [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) and sign up or log in.
2. Create a new project and a dataset (e.g., `production`).
3. Copy the following for your `.env.local`:

   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` from project settings.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` from the dataset name.

4. Use `2023-12-01` or another valid date as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION`.

### Step 3: Email Configuration

Set your email SMTP details in the environment variables:

- `HUKOT_EMAIL`: your email address
- `HUKOT_PASSWORD`: your email password
- `HUKOT_SMTP_HOST`: your email provider‚Äôs SMTP server
- `HUKOT_SMTP_PORT`: e.g., `465` (SSL) or `587` (TLS)
